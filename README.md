### Basal area loss from fire using field-calibrated remote sensing refines western U.S. fire severity measurements

This repo is very much in progress, and I will update this readme as I get it cleaned up.
Code is written by me (Sara Winsemius) and Mike Koontz, though the paper in review has many coauthors who did not contribute to code development.

Here is an INTERIM script (please use at your own risk, as the paper has not been peer-reviewed yet) for the Google Earth Engine code:

All of the R scripts will be in a sandbox until they are clean enough for others to see, at which point they will be moved to /deploy. Once things are in /deploy, they will have some description added here.
